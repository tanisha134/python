#Abstraction is a programming concept that hides complex implementation details while exposing only essential information and functionalities to users
#It allows us to hide the complexity of systems and focus only on the essential details.
# In Python, abstraction is implemented through abstract classes and methods, which make our code cleaner, more manageable, and easier to maintain.
# By using abstraction, we can divide the complexity of a program into manageable parts.
